<h1>Mapping Earthquakes</h1>
<h4>Module 13 of DU Data Bootcamp</h4>

<h2>Overview of Project</h2>
Building on our JavaScript and D3 library knowledge, we're now seeking to apply these tools to research the impact of earthquakes globally based on data provided by the USGS website. This information will be mapped, visualized, and then analyzed.

<h3>Purpose of Project</h3>
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

<h2>Analysis and Challenges</h2>

<h3>Analysis of Outcomes Based on Project</h3>
Utilizing the version control for the first time on Github was really incredible to be able to maintain the functional version of the program on the main tree and then work on additional aspects of the program on the branches. Also diving into the Leaflet maps provided another really powerful tool to create meaningful visualizations.

<h3>Analysis of Outcomes Based on Challenges and Goals</h3>
Once the initial layers and map data are added, adding additional layers to the map is relatively straightforward. It's incredible interesting to look at the earthquake data in alignment with the tectonic plate data. <img src="https://github.com/cb19weber/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/static/images/dark_all_earthquakes_and_plates.png"> In the most recent data pull, the Asian-Pacific coast region has experienced much greater density of relatively higher magnitude earthquakes than the North American Pacific coast. Interestingly, the South American Pacific coast has also experienced relatively higher magnitude quakes recently. It would be intriguing to explore the relationships of region-specific tectonic plate movement activity with earthquake magnitude.

<h3>Challenges and Difficulties Encountered</h3>
I really enjoyed this module, and the JavaScript experience as a whole. It's definitely something I'd like to continue improving on and I have a list of future projects that I'm going to undertake after the DU Data Bootcamp closes. I'll be sure to post those future endeavors to my profile.

JS overall has been pretty straightforward. There are definitely syntax nuances that differ from Python, which is my dominant programming language, so there are always moments of having to review the documentation to acheive my desired outcome.

<h2>Results</h2>
I'm extremely happy with the results, and I'm going to continue working on this page to eventually publish an active version.
